Productivity is determined by how _quickly_ a person completes a _task_ while maintaining a level of _quality_. For example, if one employee takes 20 minutes to write a report while another takes 2 hours, one can argue that the faster employee is more productive. But what if the faster employee makes 20 times more mistakes than the slower employee? Then the employer needs to reassess who's the most productive.

Tasks are essentially units of work, and work can be broken into 2 phases:

1. Planning
2. Implementation

Thus, to be productive, one needs to _expedite_ both phases. On the other hand, to be unproductive, one needs to _sabotage_ both phases.

## Planning

In the planning phase, the [Five Ws](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) are used to understand what's the work and how it's going to be done.

Hence, to sabotage this phase, one needs to make the planning of work as complex and delayed as possible. For instance:

- Set up long and unnecessary meetings with as many attendees as possible. (Bonus points if they're unnecessary participants.)
- Never talk about key issues and always go off tangent.
- Don't make decisions and obfuscate requirements.
- Focus on trivial details and make a raucous about them.
- Force approvals to go up the bureaucratic chain.
- Spread fear and toxicity within the working environment.

## Implementation

In the implementation stage, you're executing the work based on the plan. As a result, you have more agency and influence on how to sabotage this phase.

Here are some examples:

- Procrastinate and work as slowly as possible.
- Misunderstand orders and deliver low quality work with mistakes.
- Give incorrect estimates of effort.
- Never make deadlines and always ask for more time.
- Do the low priority tasks before the high priority ones.
- Create interruptions and extra work for your manager and colleagues. Steal and waste their time.
- Be someone difficult to work with.
- Share incorrect information with your coworkers.
