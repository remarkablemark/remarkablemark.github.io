## Problem

I was running [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) on iOS and got the error:

```
error Failed to launch the app on simulator, An error was encountered processing the command (domain=com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimError, code=405):
Unable to lookup in current state: Shutdown
```

## Solution

Delete [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) cache by going to:  > `About This Mac` > `Storage` > `Manage...` > `Developer` > `Project Build Data and Indexes` > `Delete...`

Rerun React Native and open the [Simulator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device) device:

```sh
npx react-native run-ios
```
